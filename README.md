Simple Moving Average is computed and plotted for basic analysis
Trading signals are created which act as indicators whether or not to invest. 
These trading signals are created using Moving Average Crossover. 
Once the model is built, backtesting is performed to assess how well the model is performing on existing data. 

# BUYING & SELLING
- When shorter moving average is above longer interval one, it indicates a downward trend, which is an optimal period to Buy.
- When shorter moving average is below the longer one, it indicates a upward trend, which is an optimal period to Sell.

If observed carefully, there was a Bullish market until May 2022. There is a rapid decline from Oct-2022 as recession hit the economy. 
Hence, it is adviced to Buy and retain the cryptocurrency until April 2023 as March 2023 shows an upward trend, which indicates that there could be a rise in price. 
It is once again very important to remember that Crypto Market is subject to economic conditions and is highly volatile.
